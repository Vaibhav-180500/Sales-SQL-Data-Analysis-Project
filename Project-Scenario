Hello Vaibhav, 
I hope you're doing great. We're looking to enhance our internet sales reporting by shifting from plain, fixed reports to interactive visual dashboards. In essence, we want to zero in on details like how much of each product we've sold, to which customers, and how this has evolved over time (Data after 2020). 
Since our sales team handles various products and clients, it would be helpful to have options to filter and focus on specific ones. We also keep track of our performance against our set budget, and I've included this data in a spreadsheet so we can easily compare our actual numbers to our targets. 
Please share your thoughts on this! 
Best regards!
